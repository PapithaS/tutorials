# Get Started With the Arduino MKR NB 1500 Dev-Kit (UDP over NB-IoT or LTE-M)

> Reading time: 45 minutes

This tutorial gives brief instructions on how to get started with the Arduino MKR1500 dev kit. This tutorial will send data from the Arduino MKR1500 dev kit using JSON formatted data in a UDP packet over the NB1 (aka NB-IoT) or the M1 (aka LTE Cat M1 or LTE-M) network.

You will learn:

How to download the Arduino Desktop IDE
How to assemble the dev kit and connect it to the Arduino Desktop IDE
How to create a Telenor Start IoT Managed IoT Cloud (MIC) platform account
How to register your dev kit in MIC and create payload transformations
How to program the dev kit and send data to MIC over Telenor’s excellent 4G LTE IoT Cat M1 network
How to view your data in MIC
You can also find a lot of info related to the Arduino MKR on Arduino´s own documentation site:

## 1. Preparations for Arduino dev kit
   This lesson will show you how to download and install the Arduino Desktop IDE. The Arduino Desktop IDE is what you will use to connect to and program your dev kit.
### Download and install the Arduino Desktop IDE
     The easiest way to program the Arduino MKR1500 dev kit is to use the Arduino Desktop IDE. You can download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage. Scroll down to the “Install the Arduino Desktop IDE” and select the link that is appropriate for your computers operating system and follow the instructions there.
